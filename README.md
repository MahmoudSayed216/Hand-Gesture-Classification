# 🤚 Hand Gesture Classification Using MediaPipe Landmarks

A machine learning project for classifying hand gestures using 21-landmark data extracted from the [HaGRID dataset](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid) via MediaPipe.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project takes a CSV file of hand landmark coordinates (x, y, z) as input and trains multiple machine learning classifiers to recognize hand gestures. The best-performing model is then used to classify gestures in real-time video.

**Key steps covered:**
- Data loading & exploration
- Landmark normalization (re-centering & scaling)
- Stratified train/test splitting
- Training and comparing multiple ML models with Grid Search
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Experiment tracking via MLflow
- Real-time gesture classification using MediaPipe

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source:** [HaGRID](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid) — Hand Gesture Recognition Image Dataset
- **Features:** 21 hand landmarks × 3 coordinates (x, y, z) = **63 features** per sample
- **Classes:** 18 hand gesture classes + `no_gesture` (added manually)
- **Class imbalance:** Ranges from ~945 samples (`fist`) to ~1653 samples (`three2`)
- A `no_gesture` class with 1000 zero-filled samples was added to handle absent hands

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn mlflow mediapipe
```

## 🔄 Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **No missing values** — confirmed via `data.info()`
2. **Added `no_gesture` class** — 1000 rows of zeros appended
3. **Stratified splitting** — `StratifiedShuffleSplit` (80/20) to preserve class ratios
4. **Landmark normalization:**
   - Re-center all (x, y) coordinates using the **wrist point** (landmark 1) as the origin
   - Scale by the **distance to the middle finger base** (landmark 13) to make all hands comparable in size
   - Z coordinates are left as-is (already normalized by MediaPipe)
5. **Label encoding** — `OrdinalEncoder` applied to gesture class labels
